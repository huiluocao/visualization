Alluvial diagrams are a specific kind of Sankey diagrams: they use the same logic to show how the same set of items regroups according to different dimensions.
A Sankey diagram visualizes the proportional flow between variables (or nodes) within a network. The term “alluvial diagram” is generally used interchangeably. However, some argue that an alluvial diagram visualizes the changes in the network over time as opposed to across different variables.
